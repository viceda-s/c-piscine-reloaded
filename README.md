## 🔎 Project Details

### 💻 C Piscine Reloaded – 100/100 🌟

- **Objective:**  
Revisit and perfect the essential concepts of the **C language** taught in the original Piscine—solidifying knowledge in memory management, string operations, function creation, and modular programming.

- **Key Features:**
  - Independent exercises focusing on discrete C fundamentals.
  - Topics include loops, pointers, arrays, recursion, and file I/O.
  - Each program compiled separately with controlled headers.
  - Compilation follows `cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror` norms.

- **Highlights:**
  - Exercises progress from simple syntax manipulation to algorithmic logic.
  - Deep understanding of standard library functions through manual reimplementation.
  - Designed for clarity, stability, and adherence to the 42 Norm.

- **Skills:**
  - Mastery of C syntax and compiler behavior.
  - Writing maintainable modular functions.
  - Debugging and testing in constrained environments.

## 📂 Repository Structure

All exercises are placed within the main folder, following naming conventions specified in the [subject.pdf](https://github.com/dpetrosy/C-piscine-reloaded/blob/master/subject.pdf):

```
c-piscine-reloaded/
│
├── ex00/
│   └── ft_putchar.c
├── ex01/
│   └── ft_print_alphabet.c
├── ex02/
│   └── ft_print_reverse_alphabet.c
│   ...
└── exNN/
    ├── <exercise_name>.c
    └── (optional) header files
```

Each exercise can be compiled individually:

```sh
cc -Wall -Wextra -Werror exNN/*.c -o exNN/output
```

## 🚀 How to Explore
